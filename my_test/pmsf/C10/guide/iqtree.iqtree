Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 0.1605

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.0001         0.2500
  2         0.0145         0.2500
  3         0.2732         0.2500
  4         3.7121         0.2500
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TREE
-----------------------

Log-likelihood of the tree: -844.1646 (s.e. 49.3619)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -702.3927
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 27
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 1742.3291
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 1750.9200
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 1831.9184

Total tree length (sum of branch lengths): 0.4733
Sum of internal branch lengths: 0.2119 (44.7764% of tree length)

NOTE: Tree is UNROOTED although outgroup taxon 'Q98N40.2' is drawn at root
Numbers in parentheses are  ultrafast bootstrap support (%)

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -844.164575
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
