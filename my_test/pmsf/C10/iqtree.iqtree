SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT
------------------

Input data: 5 sequences with 204 amino-acid sites
Number of constant sites: 163 (= 79.902% of all sites)
Number of invariant (constant or ambiguous constant) sites: 163 (= 79.902% of all sites)
Number of parsimony informative sites: 15
Number of distinct site patterns: 61

SUBSTITUTION PROCESS
--------------------

Model of substitution: LG+SSF+F+G4

State frequencies: (site specific frequencies)

Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 0.1530

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.0001         0.2500
  2         0.0118         0.2500
  3         0.2507         0.2500
  4         3.7375         0.2500
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TREE
-----------------------

Log-likelihood of the tree: -824.3872 (s.e. 46.5456)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -702.3927
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 27
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 1702.7744
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 1711.3653
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 1792.3636

Total tree length (sum of branch lengths): 0.4898
Sum of internal branch lengths: 0.2211 (45.1363% of tree length)

NOTE: Tree is UNROOTED although outgroup taxon 'Q98N40.2' is drawn at root
Numbers in parentheses are  ultrafast bootstrap support (%)

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -824.387203
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
