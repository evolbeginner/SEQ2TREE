Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 0.4353

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.0221         0.2500
  2         0.2076         0.2500
  3         0.7668         0.2500
  4         3.0035         0.2500
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TREE
-----------------------

Log-likelihood of the tree: -259.1128 (s.e. 13.1090)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -259.4033
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 134
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 786.2256
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 1713.9179
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 1209.5390

Total tree length (sum of branch lengths): 0.0895
Sum of internal branch lengths: 0.0000 (0.0000% of tree length)

WARNING: 1 near-zero internal branches (<0.0057) should be treated with caution
         Such branches are denoted by '**' in the figure below

NOTE: Tree is UNROOTED although outgroup taxon 'Q98N40.2' is drawn at root
Numbers in parentheses are  ultrafast bootstrap support (%)

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -259.112795
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
