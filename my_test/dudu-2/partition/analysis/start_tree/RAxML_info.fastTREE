Alignment has 511 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 27.16%

RAxML experimental very fast tree search

Using 4 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 10.0000000000 Log Likelihood units
